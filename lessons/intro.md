## What You Can Expect

I Build React Native App for 3 years now, my main goal in those few days is to give you an idea of how I do it - what are the best practices, conventions, do's, and dont's. By the end of the course, youâ€™ll be comfortable writing React Native App.

## What Youâ€™ll Need to Know ?

This course is targeted at beginner/intermediate developers.

If you already know React, that's perfect, since your React skills are completely transferrable to React Native.

Youâ€™ll need to have the following skills to get the most out of the course:

- Command-line experience in any operating system.
- Coding experience in Javascript.
- Reactjs beginner skills.

If it not the case, this [Beginner's Guide to React course](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react) by the amazing [Kent C. Dodds](https://egghead.io/instructors/kent-c-dodds) will help you build a solid understanding about react.

In this course, I will be using a MacBook Pro, an iPhone simulator and an Android emulator from Android Studio.

To follow this course you should have:

- A Mac, Windows or Linux machine
- A physical device (iPhone or Android) OR a simulator/emulator installed

To get the most out of the course, follow this guide, and make sure to practice what you are learning as possible as you can.
